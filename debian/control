Package: libftdi1
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Library to control and program the FTDI USB controller
 This library could talk to FTDI's FT232 and FT245 type USB chips from 
 userspace. It uses libusb to communicate with the chips.
 .
 Functionalities include the possibility to use the chips in standard
 mode, in bitbang mode, and to read or write the serial EEPROM.
 .
 This is the C version of the library.

Package: libftdi-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libftdi1 (= ${binary:Version}), libusb-dev (>= 0.1.11), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Development files for libftdi
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 compile applications that use libftdi.

Package: libftdi1-dbg
Section: debug
Priority: extra
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: libftdi1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Debugging symbols for libftdi1
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. it is provided
 primarily to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes
 it somewhat easier to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed
 in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
